  <p><font size="+1">Please consider taking the Youth Protection Training (and 
    print your Certificate of Completion). You do not have to be a registered 
    Scout Leader to take the training. Here's the link, just follow the instructions 
    on the right side of the web page: <a href="http://www.scouting.org/Training/YouthProtection.aspx">http://www.scouting.org/Training/YouthProtection.aspx</a> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">Youth Protection:</font><b> </b>The Boy Scouts of America 
    places the greatest importance on creating the most secure environment possible 
    for our youth members. To maintain such an environment, the BSA developed 
    numerous procedural and leadership selection policies and provides parents 
    and leaders with resources for the Cub Scout, Boy Scout, and Venturing programs.</p>
  <p> <font size="+2">Leadership Selection:</font>: The Boy Scouts of America 
    takes great pride in the quality of our adult leadership. Being a leader in 
    the BSA is a privilege, not a right. The quality of the program and the safety 
    of our youth members call for high-quality adult leaders. We work closely 
    with our chartered organizations to help recruit the best possible leaders 
    for their units. The adult application requests background information that 
    should be checked by the unit committee or the chartered organization before 
    accepting an applicant for unit leadership. While no current screening techniques 
    exist that can identify every potential child molester, we can reduce the 
    risk of accepting a child molester by learning all we can about an applicant 
    for a leadership position-his or her experience with children, why he or she 
    wants to be a Scout leader, and what discipline techniques he or she would 
    use.</p>
  <p> <font size="+2">Barriers to Abuse Within Scouting:</font> The BSA has adopted 
    the following policies to provide additional security for our members. These 
    policies are primarily for the protection of our youth members; however, they 
    also serve to protect our adult leaders from false accusations of abuse.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font size="+1">Two-deep leadership:</font> Two registered adult leaders 
      or one registered leader and a parent of a participant, or other adult, 
      one of whom must be 21 years of age or older, are required on all trips 
      and outings. The chartered organization is responsible for ensuring that 
      sufficient leadership is provided for all activities. </p>
    <p><font size="+1">No one-on-one contact:</font> One-on-one contact between 
      adults and youth members is not permitted. In situations that require personal 
      conferences, such as a Scoutmaster's conference, the meeting is to be conducted 
      in view of other adults and youths.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Respect of privacy:</font> Adult leaders must respect 
      the privacy of youth members in situations such as changing clothes and 
      taking showers at camp, and intrude only to the extent that health and safety 
      require. Adults must protect their own privacy in similar situations.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Cameras, imaging, and digital devices:</font> While most 
      campers and leaders use cameras and other imaging devices responsibly, it 
      has become very easy to invade the privacy of individuals. It is inappropriate 
      to use any device capable of recording or transmitting visual images in 
      shower houses, restrooms, or other areas where privacy is expected by participants.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Separate accommodations:</font> When camping, no youth 
      is permitted to sleep in the tent of an adult other than his own parent 
      or guardian. Councils are strongly encouraged to have separate shower and 
      latrine facilities for females. When separate facilities are not available, 
      separate times for male and female use should be scheduled and posted for 
      showers.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Proper preparation for high-adventure activities:</font> 
      Activities with elements of risk should never be undertaken without proper 
      preparation, equipment, clothing, supervision, and safety measures.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">No secret organizations:</font> The Boy Scouts of America 
      does not recognize any secret organizations as part of its program. All 
      aspects of the Scouting program are open to observation by parents and leaders. 
    </p>
    <p><font size="+1">Appropriate attire:</font> Proper clothing for activities 
      is required. For example, skinny-dipping is not appropriate as part of Scouting.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Constructive discipline:</font> Discipline used in Scouting 
      should be constructive and reflect Scouting's values. Corporal punishment 
      is never permitted.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Hazing prohibited:</font> Physical hazing and initiations 
      are prohibited and may not be included as part of any Scouting activity.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Junior leader training and supervision:</font> Adult leaders 
      must monitor and guide the leadership techniques used by junior leaders 
      and ensure that BSA policies are followed.</p>
    <p><font size="+1">Member responsibilities:</font> All members of the Boy 
      Scouts of America are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with 
      the principles set forth in the Scout Oath and Law. Physical violence, hazing, 
      bullying, theft, verbal insults, drugs, and alcohol have no place in the 
      Scouting program and may result in the revocation of a Scout's membership 
      in the unit.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Unit responsibilities:</font> The head of the chartered 
      organization or chartered organization representative and the local council 
      must approve the registration of the unit's adult leader. Adult leaders 
      of Scouting units are responsible for monitoring the behavior of youth members and interceding when necessary. Parents of youth members who misbehave should be informed and asked for assistance in dealing with it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <font size="+1">Digital Privacy:</font> A key ingredient for a safe and 
    healthy Scouting experience is the respect for privacy. Advances in  technology are enabling new forms of social interaction that extend beyond the appropriate use of cameras or recording devices (see "Barriers to Abuse Within Scouting"). Sending sexually explicit photographs or videos electronically or "sexting" by cell phones is a form of texting being practiced primarily by young adults and children as young as middle-school age. Sexting is neither safe, nor private, nor an approved form of communication and can lead to severe legal consequences for the sender and the receiver. Although most campers and leaders use digital devices responsibly, educating them about the appropriate use of cell phones and cameras would be a good safety and privacy measure. </p>
  <p><font size="+1">The "three R's" of Youth Protection:</font> The "three R's" 
    of Youth Protection convey a simple message to youth members:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font size="+1">Recognize</font> situations that place you at risk of 
      being molested, how child molesters operate, and that anyone could be a 
      molester.</p>
    <p><font size="+1"> Resist</font> unwanted and inappropriate attention. Resistance will stop most attempts at molestation.</p>
    <p> <font size="+1">Report</font> attempted or actual molestation to a parent or other trusted adult. This prevents further abuse and helps to protect other children. Let the Scout know he or she will not be blamed for what occurred. </p>
