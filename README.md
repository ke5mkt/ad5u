Revamping an old website for a friend.

First step has been to strip the html file of all the styling and superfluity and create a simple html file. Later I may create a separate style sheet and a separate javascript file if necessary.

I have a couple of pictures of this guy and his scouts that may make a good addition to this page.


## TO DO ##

1. Need some BSA approved pictures of kids on the radio.
2. Write the about page
3. Change the links to other pages on this site after I get them un-uglied.
4. get my links off and put SJ's on there
5. Find some BSA logos for decoration
6. OH I simply must clean up this messy code as well.
